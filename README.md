# AMP PHP Library

### What is the AMP PHP Library?

The AMP PHP Library is an open source and pure PHP Library that:
- Works with whole or partial HTML documents (or strings). Specifically, the AMP PHP Library:
 - Reports compliance of the whole/partial HTML document with the [AMP HTML standard](https://www.ampproject.org/)
 - Implements an AMP HTML validator in pure PHP to report compliance of an arbitrary HTML document / HTML fragment with the AMP HTML standard. This validator is a ported subset of the [canonical validator](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/validator) that is implemented in javascript. In particular this PHP validator does not (yet) support template, cdata, css and layout validation. Otherwise, it supports tag specification validation, attribute specification validation and attribute property value pair validation. It will report tags and attributes that are missing, illegal, mandatory according to spec but not present, unique according to spec but multiply present, having wrong parents or ancestors and so forth.
 - Using the feedback given by the validator, tries to "correct" some issues found in the HTML to make it more AMP HTML compliant. This would involve removing illegal attributes (e.g. `style`) or illegal tags (e.g. `<script>`) in the body portion of the HTML document. This correction is currently basic. _Note_: the library needs to be provided with well formed html. Please don't give it faulty, incorrect html (e.g. non closed `<div>` tags etc). The correction it does is related to AMP HTML standard issues only. Use a HTML tidying library if you expect your HTML to be malformed.
 - Converts some non-amp elements to their AMP equivalents automatically
    - An `<img>` tag is automatically converted to an `<amp-img>` tag
    - An `<iframe>` tag is converted to an `<amp-iframe>`
    - [Standard twitter embed code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lullabot/amp-library/master/test-html/twitter-fragment.html) is converted to an `<amp-twitter>` tag. _Note_: the conversion will work even if no `<script>` tag was provided after the embed code (as shown in the example).
    - [Standard instagram embed code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lullabot/amp-library/master/test-html/instagram-fragment.html) is converted to an `<amp-instagram>` tag. _Note_: the conversion will work even if no `<script>` tag was provided after the embed code (as shown in the example).
    - More such automatic conversions are planned for the future 
- Provides both a console and programmatic interface with which to call the library. It works like this: the programmer/user provides some HTML and we return (1) The AMPized HTML (2) A list of warnings reported by the Validator (3) A list of fixes/tag conversions made by the library

### Use Cases

- Currently the AMP PHP Library is used by the [Drupal AMP Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/amp) to report issues with user entered, arbitrary HTML (originating from Rich Text Editors) and converting the HTML to AMPized HTML (as much as possible)
- The AMP PHP Library command line validator can be used for experimentation and to do HTML to AMP HTML conversion of HTML files. While the [canonical validator](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/validator) only validates, our library tries to make corrections too. As noted above, our validator is a subset of the canonical validator but already covers a lot of cases
- The AMP PHP Library can be used in any other PHP project to "convert" HTML to AMP HTML and report validation issues. It does not have any non-PHP dependencies and will work in PHP 5.5+

### Setup

The project uses a [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) workflow. If you're not familiar with composer then please read up on it before trying to set this up.

Using this in Drupal requires some specific steps. Please refer to the [Drupal AMP Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/amp) documentation.

For all other scenarios, continue reading.

#### Setup for command line console

`git clone` this repo, `cd` into it and type in `$ composer install` at the command prompt to get all the dependencies of the library. Now you'll be able to use the command line AMP html converter `amp-console` (or equivalently `amp-console.php`

#### Setup for your composer based PHP project

To use this in your composer based PHP project, refer to [composer docs here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#loading-a-package-from-a-vcs-repository)

 But essentially, you need to add the following snippet in your `composer.json`:

 ```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://github.com/Lullabot/amp-library"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "lullabot/amp": "dev-master"
    }
 ```

After doing this issue `$ composer update lullabot/amp`. 

The library is currently not hosted on [Packagist](https://packagist.org) but we plan to do that in the near future. After that happens you will need to do a simpler `$ composer require lullabot/amp` invocation rather than the above steps.

### Using the command line `amp-console`

```bash
$ cd <amp-php-library-repo-cloned-location>
# Do this if you haven't already
$ composer install
$ ./amp-console amp:convert --help
$ ./amp-console amp:convert <name-of-html-document> <options> 
```

Please note that the `--help` command line option is your friend. Use that when confused!

A few example HTML files are available in the test-html folder for you to test drive so that you can get a flavor of the AMP PHP library.

```bash
$ ./amp-console amp:convert test-html/sample-html-fragment.html
$ ./amp-console amp:convert test-html/regexps.html --full-document
```
Note that you need to provide `--full-document` if you're providing a full html document file for conversion.

Lets see the output output of the first example command above. The first few lines is the AMPized HTML provided by our library. The rest of the headings are self explanatory.

```html
$ cd <amp-php-library-repo-cloned-location>
$ ./amp-console amp:convert test-html/sample-html-fragment.html

### Using the library in a composer based PHP project

First, follow the setup steps above if you're using this in a composer based project.

Sample code to get started:

```php
<?php

use Lullabot\AMP\AMP;
use Lullabot\AMP\Validate\Scope;

// Create an AMP object
$amp = new AMP();

// Notice this is a HTML fragment, i.e. anything that can appear below <body>
$html =
    '<p><a href="javascript:run();">Run</a></p>' . PHP_EOL .
    '<p><a style="margin: 2px;" href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_parent">CNN</a></p>' . PHL_EOL .
    '<p><a href="http://www.bbcnews.com" target="_blank">BBC</a></p>' . PHP_EOL .
    '<p><INPUT type="submit" value="submit"></p>' . PHP_EOL .
    '<p>This is a <div onmouseover="hello();">sample</div> paragraph</p>';

// Load up the HTML into the AMP object
$amp->loadHtml($html);

// If you're feeding it a complete document use the following line instead
// $amp->loadHtml($html, ['scope' => Scope::HTML_SCOPE]);

// Convert to AMP HTML and store output in a variable
$amp_html = $amp->convertToAmpHtml();

// Print AMP HTML
print($amp_html);

// Print validation issues and fixes made to HTML provided in the $html string
print($amp->warningsHumanText());

// HTML escaped warnings
// print($amp->warningsHumanHtml());

// You can do the above steps all over again without having to create a fresh object
// $amp->loadHtml($another_string)
// ...
// ...

```

### Caveats and Known issues

- This is beta quality code. You are likely to encounter bugs and errors, both fatal and harmless. Please help us improve this library by using the GitHub issue tracker on this repository to report errors
 - If you have `<img>`s with `https` urls _and_ they don't have height/width attributes _and_ you are using PHP 5.6 or PHP 7.0 the library may have problems converting these to `<amp-img>`. This is because of http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.openssl.php . That link also has a work around. 
- The library is currently not hosted on [Packagist](https://packagist.org) but we plan to do that in the near future
